# SonarSupportForPyFirmata2

This project is a result of the curriculum planners at my university being fucking idiots. They have decided that the best way to learn working 
with Arduinoâ€™s was not to do it the regular way, just using Arduino Sketch which has thousands of pages of documentation and fan made tutorials. 
But to instead use a sketchy ass python library whose code looks like a christmas tree. To add insult to injury they also require us that we make use 
of a HC-SR04 Sonar, something that.... surprise surprise this 700 line 1 class shithole that calls itself pyFirmata2 does not support. 
Thus I had to modify the firmata image (witch is actually what's being run on the arduino and sends data to the library) and add a supporting class on top of the library itself
so I could get full points for the assignment. Anyway if you are also required to use pyFirmata2 or (for some reason) use it voluntarily. Here's a simple solution for adding support for sonars.

## Usage
### hardware
Sonar connection (from sonar to arduino)
- connect vcc to 5v
- connect gnd to gnd
- connect echo and trigger to 2 digital pins
### software
- run the `modifiedFirmata.ino` file in the Arduino IDE on your arduino
- pip install [pyFirmata2](https://github.com/berndporr/pyFirmata2/tree/master)
- Include `util` from pyFirmata2 in your project
- Include `ArduinoWithSonar` from the `arduinoWithSonar.py` file in your project
- initialise your board as an `ArduinoWithSonar` object
- initialise the iterator  (`it = util.Iterator(board)`)
- start the iterator (`it.start()`)
  - *NOTE: The iterator is needed to continuously measure with the sonar*
- Have fun with the extra functionality
- see `example.py` for further clarification

## Important functions

### sonar_config(`trigger_pin`, `echo_pin`, `sonar_cature_history size (default=1`)
Sets up the sonar. 
for now only one sonar is supported at a time

if a `sonar_capture_history_size` above 1 is set then the sonar will return the mode of the last `sonar_capture_history_size` measurements for greater accuracy.
However this comes to the detriment of the speed of the updates

### get_sonar_measurement()
returns the latest measured distance in centimeters


## pyFirmata2
This software is an extention of the pyFirmata2 library.
