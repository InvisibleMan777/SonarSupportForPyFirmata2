# SonarSupportForPyFirmata2

This project is a result of the curriculum planners at my university being fucking idiots. They have decided that the best way to learn working 
with Arduinoâ€™s was not to do it the regular way, just using Arduino Sketch which has thousands of pages of documentation and fan made tutorials. 
But to instead use a sketchy ass python library whose code looks like a christmas tree. To add insult to injury they also require us that we make use 
of a HC-SR04 Sonar, something that.... surprise surprise this 700 line 1 class shithole that calls itself pyFirmata2 does not support. 
Thus I had to modify the firmata image and (witch is actually what's being run on the arduino and sends data to the library) and add a supporting class on top of the library itself
so I could get full points for the assignment. Anyway if you are also required to use pyFirmata2 or (for some reason) use it voluntarily. Here's a simple solution for adding support for sonars.
